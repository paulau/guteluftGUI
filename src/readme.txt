Version_00_QtHelloWorld : The work started with making hallo world application.
Version_01_Form: The work continued making simple application on the base of single Widget - Form 
Version_02_MainWindow with some more advanced functionality, but shitte developer work without possibility to

NOTE: 
Readin of readme.txt of versions 00 01 02 could help. Well especialy of previous version for current version
